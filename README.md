# Charge Share (Beta)

Charge Share is an app which will not only help EV owners find nearby charging stations, but create an interactive space which will allow users to efficiently navigate the app based on their preferences. The ability to rent out your own chargers will make Charge Share a space that allows EV owners to take full advantage of their communities charging network. This becomes especially significant for EV owners who live in areas that don't have many public charging stations.

When you open charge share you will be asked to share your location before being greeted by the main map which will show you all nearby EV stations within a few miles of your current location. On the map, the user can pan, zoom, rotate, just like you can on google maps, and stations where you move wil populate on the screen. Once you are loaded in the app you can click on the account page to register with us in order to unlock all of the features the app has to offer!
